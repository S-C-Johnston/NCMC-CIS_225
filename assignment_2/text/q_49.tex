In the `figures' project, a boolean was used for the field `isVisible'.
This was an appropriate use for a boolean type, since `isVisible' was
best framed as a true-or-false with only two possible states. Generally,
boolean is desireable for handling cases that will only ever have two
states, those states not being themselves strings.
