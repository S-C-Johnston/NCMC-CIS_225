In the naive ticketMachine, the `printTicket' method incremented the
value of `total' by the value of `balance', before zeroing `balance'. In
the better ticketMachine, the values `total' and `balance' are
incremented and decremented, respectively, by the value of `price'. This
can only happen if `balance' is at least `price', so negative values of
balance can't be accidentally reached.
