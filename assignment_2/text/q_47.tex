If the conditional in the `insertMoney' method is changed to check for
`greater than or equal to zero', then values of 0 become acceptable
input, and zero is added to the balance. It's debatable on whether this
is desireable behavior or not. I'm inclined that it is not desirable,
because 0 is not useful in this context, and the state is touched for no
reason whatsoever.
