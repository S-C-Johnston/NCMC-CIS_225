The version of the `refundBalance' method found in the text for this
question first zeroes out the value of `balance' before returning it.
This will always return 0, even if the state is changed to any other
legal value.

The only tests I can think of to demonstrate this are to modify the
state of `balance' with different legal values, and then attempt to call
this method.
