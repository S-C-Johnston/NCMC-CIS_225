	\item [Does order of the keywords in the statement
		\texttt{private int price} matter?] Yes. `int' is a
		type, and type declarations take an identifier as their
		next syntactic component.
	\item [Does the diagram change to reflect this?] Yes. As when
		futzing with the order of keywords for the class
		declaration, the diagram paints crosshatches over the
		TicketMachine box.
