When \verb|changeColor| is invoked with a parameter not enclosed in
quotes, the method returns an error that it cannot find a symbol of the
variable red. It looks like when passing this parameter, rather than
interpreting red as a string, it interprets it as a variable in that
scope, and it attempts to read the value thereof. With no such variable
declared, it would naturally err out.
