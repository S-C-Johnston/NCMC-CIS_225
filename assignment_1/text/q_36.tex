My understanding is that an object can be of one class. That class may
extend or be composed of an arbitrary number of other classes, but the
object takes its constructor fields from one class. An object can also
have other objects as data, such as an array of objects, or the picture
class from earlier, which instantiated and manipulated Squares, a
Triangle, a Circle, etc.
