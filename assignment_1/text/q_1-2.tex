When \verbatim|moveDown| is called repeatedly on the same object, the window
with the object redraws the object increasingly further down. When
\verbatim|makeInvisible| is called repeatedly on the same object, there
is no error, but the window in which the object was being drawn is moved
behind other windows in my compositing window manager.
