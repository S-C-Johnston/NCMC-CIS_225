	\item [0] An int.
	\item [``hello''] A String, which is an array of chars.
	\item [101] Likely an int, since it is smaller than 127. 
	\item [-1] In C nomenclature, this would be a signed int, but
		here in Javaland this is just an int.
	\item [true] A boolean
	\item [``33''] Despite how it looks, this is a string, not an int.
		The syntax of being enclosed in double-quotes is what
		tells me this.
	\item [3.1415] A floating point, representation of tasty, tasty
		pi.
