It is likely that the Picture class, in its constructor, creates and
handles new instances of the Square, Triangle, and Circle classes, and
manipulates them as needed into position and color.

When the \verb|draw()| method is called on a picture, it's likely that
it invokes, from back to front layers, the \verb|makeVisible()| method
of the appropriate objects.

For as much as I know about OOP at this time, that's all I can think of
to replicate the implementation.
