This book, ``Objects First with Java'', is an object. That is to say, it
is an instance of the ``book'' class. As such, it has a title, an array
of author(s), a page count, and body text and images. (Though if I were
handling a book object, I'd probably not pass around a whole blob of its
contents, rather, I'd pass around a pointer to the location of that
data.)
